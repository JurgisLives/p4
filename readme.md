## Chefmaster Proforma Budgeting Tool


ChefMaster is a web application that allows users to input their general accounting information each month, It will eventually have a lot more functionality, currently it just allows users to edit, view and delete their forms.
*As of the 18th of December this application fulfilled most of the requirements of the assignment, User Authentication, CRuD operations, 2 database tables, etc. It is not pretty, and it was an arduous process getting this far, but I will continue to work on it until it is a viable and useful product.
